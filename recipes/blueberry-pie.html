            These are the ingredients you'll need to make this top-rated blueberry pie recipe:  
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Sugar:</strong> This blueberry pie recipe starts with a cup of white sugar.</li>
            <li><strong>Cornstarch:</strong> Cornstarch thickens the blueberry pie filling, preventing runniness.</li>
            <li><strong>Cinnamon:</strong> Ground cinnamon adds subtle warmth.</li>
            <li><strong>Salt:</strong> A inch of salt enhances the overall flavor of the blueberry pie filling, but it won't make it taste salty.</li>

            <li><strong>Pie crust:</strong> Use a store-bought or homemade pastry crust.</li>
            <li><strong>Butter:</strong> You'll need just a tablespoon of butter.</li>
